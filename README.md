This is a data visualisation of a niche set of Pokemon data

The selection bar at the top will allow the user to choose a generation of Pokemon, which will display a header and change the step to the selected generation.

The React Three Fiber canvas will then generate an interactive programmatic bar chart with the chart representing the whole generation, each bar representing a type of Pokemon and the height of the bar representing how many Pokemon of that type appeared in each generation.

When selected, a bar will then display a list of all the Pokemon of that type in that generation along the bottom of the screen, with links to another website with details of that Pokemon.
